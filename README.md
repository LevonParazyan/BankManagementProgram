# BankManagementProgram

This is a simple program for Banking system, that can do several things like creating accounts, cheking accounts balance, transferring cash between accounts and so on.
Also important part is that here is used fstream (input/output stream class) for working with files that gives us chance to store our data, so you will not loose your data
after closing project or say because of elecricity problems.
